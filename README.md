Interhemispheric Interactions of the Human Thalamic Reticular Nucleus: Journal Of Neuroscience 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the code required to replicate the methods I used & developed for this paper, currently in press. I wrote all of it a few years ago, when I was a complete novice, so I can't garuntee it will be hassle-free. I've been meaning to integrate some of these methods into NiNet for a while, so watch that space, but in the meantime, this repository should be of use if you are interested in these methods.

If you find these methods helpful, please be sure to [reference our paper](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/5/2026.short).
