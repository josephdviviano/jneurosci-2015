Interhemispheric Interactions of the Human Thalamic Reticular Nucleus: Journal Of Neuroscience 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the code required to replicate the methods I used & developed for this paper, currently in press. I wrote all of it a few years ago, when I was a complete novice, so I can't garuntee it will be hassle-free. I've been meaning to integrate some of these methods into NiNet for a while, so watch that space, but in the meantime, this repository should be of use if you are interested in these methods.

If you find these methods helpful, please be sure to reference our paper.
