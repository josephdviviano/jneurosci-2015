This repository contains the code required to replicate the methods I used & developed for this paper, currently in press. I wrote all of it a few years ago, when I was a complete novice, so I can't garuntee it will be hassle-free. I've been meaning to integrate some of these methods into NiNet for a while, so watch that space, but in the meantime, this repository should be of use if you are interested in these methods.

If you find these methods helpful, please be sure to [reference our paper](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/5/2026.short).

**stimuli**

Contains `tremotopy.m`, which is the stimulus we presented to participants in the paper.

**simulations**

Contains code used to determine optimal stimulus timing (not presented in paper).

**preproc**

Code used to pre-process the fMRI and proton-density images.

**analysis**

Code used to perform the analysis in the paper. Most scripts have settings at the beginning of the file, which must be hand-set for each run.

**cover**

Code and images for my attempt at the cover. I didn't get it, but if you are intested in how to make this sort of image, see my [guide](http://www.viviano.ca/writing/jneurosci-cover-tutorial/).
