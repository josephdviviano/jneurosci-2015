Functional connectivity of the left ventral human thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN; white) with the left and right lateral geniculate nuclei (red and blue, respectively). Each node of the graph represents a single fMRI voxel, with the thickness of graph edges denoting time series correlation magnitude. Adjacent to the graph are the fMRI traces used to draw the correlations. Here, 20 arbitrary voxels are depicted from each anatomical structure. Only positive correlations are depicted. The topography of this graph was determined using the Frushterman-Reingold algorithm, which arranges the nodes to be closest to those with complementary correlation patterns. This visualization demonstrates the interhemispheric functional connectivity of the left TRN with both hemispheres of the visual thalamus, and suggests the structure participates in an interhemispheric inhibitory circuit.
